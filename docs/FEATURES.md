## Comprehensive Test Generation

TestTeller goes beyond simple test case generation. It acts as a virtual QA architect, analyzing your provided documents and code to create a strategic and comprehensive test suite.

### Test Types Generated

#### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
Generates detailed test cases designed to validate complete user journeys across the entire stack. These tests ensure that the integrated system functions correctly from the user's perspective, covering:
- UI interactions
- Backend data processing  
- Event propagation
- Cross-component workflows

#### Integration Tests  
Creates test scenarios to verify contracts and interactions between components:
- Frontend-Backend connections
- Service-to-service API calls
- Event-driven flows
- Component communication and cooperation

#### Technical Tests
Goes beyond functional testing to generate scenarios that probe system limitations:
- **Performance**: Stress, load, and soak testing hypotheses
- **Resilience**: Retry policies, timeouts, and graceful degradation
- **Security**: Common vulnerabilities and access control issues
- **Edge Cases**: Concurrency, race conditions, and unexpected inputs

#### Mocked System Tests
Produces test cases for service and component-level testing:
- Isolated services or functions testing
- Clear mock behaviors for external dependencies
- Component logic validation in isolation

### Intelligent Test Strategy
