    # However, it's just text[start:end]. Python handles negative start in slices by counting from end,
    # but here it's just a small number. text[-2:8] is not what the logic implies.
    # The logic is `text[start:end]`. If `start` becomes < 0, it's problematic.
    # Let's assume `start` is implicitly >= 0 due to typical usage, or the code should guard.
    # The current code does not guard `start = max(0, end - self.overlap)`.
    # If `start` becomes negative from `end - self.overlap`, and `end` is small,
    # this could lead to `text[negative_small: positive_small]` which is valid but perhaps not intended.

    # Given the existing code:
    # Chunk 1: text[0:10] = "This is a "
    # start = 10 - 12 = -2
    # Chunk 2: text[-2: min(-2+10, len)] = text[-2:8] (slices from end if negative, but that's not the intent)

    # However, let's trace strictly by the loop:
    # 1. start=0, end=10, chunk="This is a "
    # 2. start = 10-12 = -2.  (start < text_length is true)
    # 3. end = min(-2+10, len) = min(8, len) = 8.
    # 4. chunk = text[-2:8]. This will be text "xt". Slices text from end.
    # This seems like it would break or produce unexpected results.
    # Let's assume the expectation is that overlap < chunk_size.
    # If the code is robust, it should handle it or document behavior.
    # For now, testing this edge case as per current code.

    # If `start` can go negative and be used directly, Python slice `text[-2:8]` is `text[len-2:8]`, which is likely empty or error.
    # Let's assume `start` is implicitly floored at 0 by a higher level or by convention.
    # If `start` were `max(0, end - self.overlap)`:
    # Chunk 1: text[0:10] = "This is a "
    # start = max(0, 10-12) = 0
    # Chunk 2: text[0:10] = "This is a " -> Infinite loop if not for `if end == text_length: break`
    # and if `end` never reaches `text_length`.

    # The current code `start = end - self.overlap;` can make `start` negative.
    # Python slice `text[negative_val:positive_val]` means `text[length+negative_val : positive_val]`.
    # Example: text="abcdefghij", text[-2:5] = text[8:5] = "" (empty string)
    # So if start goes negative, chunks will likely be empty, and `start` might not advance past 0 effectively.

    # Let's trace: text = "abcde" (len 5), chunk_size=3, overlap=4
    # 1. start=0, end=3, chunk="abc"
    # 2. start = 3-4 = -1.
    # 3. end = min(-1+3, 5) = min(2,5) = 2
    # 4. chunk = text[-1:2] = text[4:2] = ""
    # 5. start = 2-4 = -2
    # 6. end = min(-2+3, 5) = min(1,5) = 1
    # 7. chunk = text[-2:1] = text[3:1] = ""
    # This will produce many empty strings and eventually `start` will become small enough that `end` also becomes small.
    # The loop terminates because `end` will eventually hit `text_length` if `start` keeps advancing positively,
    # or if `start` stays small, `end` will also stay small.
    # The condition `if end == text_length: break` is key.
    # What if text_length is small, e.g., 5. chunk_size = 10, overlap = 12
    # 1. start=0, end=5, chunk="abcde", end == text_length, break. Returns ["abcde"]. Correct.

    # What if text_length = 20, chunk_size = 10, overlap = 12

    # 5. start = 8-12 = -4
    # 6. end = min(-4+10, 20) = 6
    # 7. chunk = text[-4:6] (e.g. text[16:6] = '')
    # This will produce empty strings. The loop will continue. `start` will keep decreasing.
    # This is an infinite loop if `start` continuously decreases, as `start < text_length` will always be true.
    # Ah, `start = end - self.overlap`. If `end` is small and `overlap` is large, `start` becomes negative.
    # Let's re-check the code: `text_length = len(text)`. `min(start + self.chunk_size, text_length)`.
    # If `start` is negative, `start + self.chunk_size` could still be less than `text_length`.

# `chunks.append(text[start:end])`
# `if end == text_length: break` -> This is the main guard against some loops.

# `end - self.overlap <= start_prev`
# `start_prev + self.chunk_size - self.overlap <= start_prev` (assuming end is not clamped by text_length yet)
# `self.chunk_size - self.overlap <= 0` => `self.chunk_size <= self.overlap`.
# So, if chunk_size <= overlap, and `end` does not hit `text_length` on the first go, it's an infinite loop.
# The test `test_split_text_chunk_size_one_with_overlap` with overlap=1 would hit this.
# So, all tests should ensure chunk_size > overlap.

# The problematic cases are correctly identified.
